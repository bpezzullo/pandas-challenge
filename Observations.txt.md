 Homework
 I took on Heroes of Pymoli.  I started a little of PyCitySchools, but was not able to finish it. In the folder HeroesOfPymoli there are 2 files.  The file HeroesOfPymoli.ipynb is the complete code. Load that up into Jupyter notebooks with the folder Resources and the file 'purchae_data_csv in it. 
 
 Observations:
 1. The average female players spent more than the males. Possibly they were older
 2. There was a higher percentage of female players purchasing.  Possibly more dedicated.
 3. The main segment with purchasing power was the 20-24 year olds.
