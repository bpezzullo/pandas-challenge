 Homework
 I took on Heroes of Pymoli.  I started a little of PyCitySchools, but was not able to finish it. In the folder HeroesOfPymoli there are 2 files.  The file HeroesOfPymoli.ipynb is the complete code.  
 
 Observations:
 1 While there was more male players, the female players spent on average more, but they weren't the top spenders.  There was a higher percentage of female players purchasing.  Possibly more dedicated.
 2 The main segment with purchase power was the 20 year olds.
